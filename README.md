<h1 align="center">SPA Web POS System with Bootstrap Framework 🌐📝‍💻</h1>

**Description🔻**

This project is a web-based Point of Sale (POS) system that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, designed to simplify sales and streamline business operations. It leverages the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface and incorporates regular expressions (regex) for data validation. Behind the scenes, it utilizes arrays to serve as databases for the backend.The project is primarily built using <br>**✦ HTML, <br>✦ CSS, & <br>✦ JavaScript**.

**The MVC architecture separates the project into three key components:**

**〽️ Model:** This component manages the underlying data and business logic. In this project, it handles the data related to customers, items, and orders using arrays as databases to store and retrieve information efficiently.

**✌️ View:** The View component is responsible for rendering the user interface, and in this project, it includes the HTML and CSS for the different sections of the application. Bootstrap is used to enhance the design and ensure a responsive layout, making the application accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

**©️ Controller:** The Controller component acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user interactions and the application's core functionality. In this project, there are separate controllers for managing customers, items, and orders. Data retrieved from the arrays is processed and displayed to the user.

**🔑Key features of this POS system include:**

**⚙️ Customer Management:** Users can search for customers, add new customer details, update customer information, and delete customer records, with the data being stored in arrays functioning as databases. A table displays customer information.

**⚙️ Item Management:** It offers features for searching and managing items in a store, including adding, updating, and deleting item records stored in arrays. A table displays item details.

**⚙️ Order Management:** Users can create invoices, add items to a cart, apply discounts, and calculate totals, with orders and order details being stored in arrays as databases. The system maintains tables for order items and order records.

**🔆 The project also incorporates additional features such as responsive navigation,
<br>🏷Animations using AOS (Animate on Scroll), 
<br>🏷External libraries like Toastr for notifications,
<br>🏷SweetAlert2 for modals.**

Overall, this web-based POS system combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, alongside MVC architecture, regex-based validation, and arrays as databases, making it an efficient solution for businesses to manage sales and inventory.
